0.8.2 (2015-11-05)

Added:
- Displaying applied delays in event log (tracker) page if there was one. Users can now filter based on added delays
  by adding "d:200" to display all 200 ms delays, operators like >, <, >=, <= are also available.

0.8.1 (2015-11-04)

Added:
- Database authentication. Now you can specify MongoDB user (mongo.user) and password (mongo.password) in the .ini file.
- Now looking for environment variables for database connection setup:
  + export MONGO_URI=mongodb://<dbuser>:<dbpassword>@mongo_host:mongo_port/database
  + export MONGO_DB=stubodb
- Cache (Redis) connection info can now be supplied through environment variables:
  + export REDIS_ADDRESS=new_hostname_or_ip
  + export REDIS_PORT=6379
  + export REDIS_PASSWORD=very_secret
  More information can be found here: https://github.com/SpectoLabs/mirage/wiki/Configuration

Changed:

Fixed:
- Track all hosts not showing information for all hostnames due to bug when loading initial cookie.


0.8.0 (2015-10-27)

Added:
- Documentation for Tracker API and how to create useful queries. Also, created documentation for Tracker record details.

Changed:
- Disabled certificate verification when importing scenarios (executing commands)
- Changed all REST API (v2) URL paths: removed "/stubo/" from URL since it doesn't hold any information and there is no
  point in providing application former name inside url.
- Updated documentation, tests to accommodate URL changes.

0.7.2 (2015-10-26)

Added:
- Direct upload API (addresses https://github.com/SpectoLabs/mirage/issues/10). Now users can upload exported .zip files
  directly into Mirage. There were also few modifications how Mirage parses .yaml configuration files such as
  now it only reads scenario and session names. All archived .json files will be treated as stubs and will be
  imported under the same scenario. This will make it easier to generate initial test data since you don't have
  to updated .yaml configuration file with each created stub file. Multiple PRs.

Changed:
- Changed how Mirage exports scenarios to ".yaml" files. Now it doesn't add some non compatible tags like {{values}} to yaml file since
  readers couldn't parse that information. Those lines were added to export files so it would be possible to change values
  during import but it is a lot easier to do that with standard "yaml" libraries.
- Delete scenario button is now disabled by default if scenario has active sessions in "playback" or "record" mode.
- Updates to documentation https://github.com/SpectoLabs/mirage/pull/62,  https://github.com/SpectoLabs/mirage/pull/61.

Fixed:
- Fixed bug when you could have deleted scenario which had active sessions. PR: https://github.com/SpectoLabs/mirage/pull/49

Removed:
- Documentation cleanup in https://github.com/SpectoLabs/mirage/pull/62,  https://github.com/SpectoLabs/mirage/pull/61. A lot
  of content added to project wiki https://github.com/SpectoLabs/mirage/wiki. Since it is a lot easier to maintain wiki than
  sphinx docs - only essential, tightly coupled information like API reference and few other things were left in traditional
  docs.

0.7.1 (2015-10-20):

Added:
- Added button to create scenario where users can also specify a session name and Mirage will start recording.
- "End all sessions" button now instead of being disabled for dormant sessions - switches either to "begin playback"
  or "start recording" based on current stub count.
- Added new API for getting information about found response (similar to get stub response) although instead of Mirage
  just using that information to create the original response - it now provides data about desired headers, body and
  status code. This enables proxy to store encoded data inside Mirage with required headers for decoding and then
  recreating original response without tampering with it. Original design was limited to plain text only.
- Users can now override session and scenario by supplying any hostname. So a user that is accessing Mirage through the
  hostname A - can also create scenario, start session and end it for host B. This was needed for running Mirage in container
  environment where communication between proxy and Mirage was established via DNS aliases (or links).
- Added all javascript libraries to source control to make development and management easier.

Changed:
- By default user is now tracking all hosts (you can still choose to see only your host and that value will be saved in a cookie).
  This was needed due to the fact that while running Mirage in a container - it' fairly difficult to know on which hostname
  Mirage is accessible through the container network or any other SDN.
- Date rolling by default now expects YYYY/MM/DD instead of YYYY/DD/MM.

Deprecated:

Removed:
- Old design templates
- Old web UI handlers, utilities (in service/api.py)
- Old web UI javascript files and CSS styles

Fixed:
- Fixed bug when due to websocket being blocked - tracker page failed to load new pages and filter. Now if it's available
  in browser but terminated upon creation (i.e. firewall blocks it) - it will fall back to HTTP calls.
- When ensuring tracker indexes during startup - Mirage now reuses initial MongoDB connection, this solves some bugs when
  running in a container environment.
- Fixed problem when during startup Mirage also tried to import some functions from testing packages that required
  testing dependencies.

0.7 (2015-10-02)

Added:
- REST API for Mirage management. This API currently covers most of the management commands
  although it may slightly change (for example current "get response stub" request body is likely to be changed)
  This new API also has new functionality that was not available in the previous JSON API such as Tracker collection
  record filtering and pagination through REST. It also provides WebSocket supported filtering to speed up search
  in Tracker.
- Moved from Tornado template engine to React.js.
- New UI based on React.js framework. All web UI has been restructured, old /manage page was removed and its functionality
  split into "management" side menu where users can directly access scenario, module, delay policies or direct command
  execution pages. All of the data to this front-end is supplied by the new REST APIv2 and almost nothing is rendered
  on the server side (except for showing current Mirage version, however that may also change in future releases)
- Webpack configuration for compiling .jsx files to .js, this creates javascript bundles that can be easily imported
  in the separate pages and decreases loading time.
- Dockerfile for building Mirage Docker image and separate docker-compose script to launch dockerized Mirage environment
  that interconnects through container network.
- Syntax highlighting for

Changed:
- Deployment and application startup has been changed. Now, instead of executing setup.py, copying configuration to
  virtualenv and then from there launching Mirage by calling "stubo" command (that was far from standard approach at
  launching Python application) - it was changed to installing requirements from requirements.txt file with pip and then
  executing "python run.py" in the project root.
- Tracker collection is now being checked during each application startup. Mirage now checks whether it exists and can
  create a capped collection if it' not there. Then it ensures indexes.


Deprecated:
- Current web UI is currently deprecated, although not removed.
- Current handlers, handlers_mt, api functionality for serving and legacy UI is deprecated.

Fixed:

- Multiple open connections to MongoDB during tests
- Performance degradation due to indexing fixed
- Fault in multi-date rolling (BA issue)
